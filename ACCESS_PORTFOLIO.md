## 💡 If You're Seeing "Log into Vite":

This is **NOT** normal. Vite is a build tool, not a login system. This might mean:

1. **Browser extension issue** - Try disabling ad blockers
2. **Cached old version** - Clear cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Network issue** - Try different network/WiFi
4. **DNS propagation** - Wait a few minutes
